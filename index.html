          <p>Status effects can come from various sources, such as weapons, assists, passives, Duo/Harmonized skills, Emblem Effects, Captain Skills, items, or structures. There are currently 81 status effects in the game, which are split into positive status effects and negative status effects. Status effects either affect the player's units or enemy units. Skills such as Gainful Bow+ and Atk/Spd Prime 4 have effects that work based on how many status effects are active on the targeted unit(s). For sources of status effects, see the category page Category:Sources of status effects.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>If decreasing the Spd difference necessary to make a follow-up attack by 25 would allow unit to trigger a follow-up attack (excluding guaranteed or prevented follow-ups), triggers【Potent Follow X%】during combat (if unit cannot perform follow-up and attack twice, <code>X = 80; otherwise, X = 40)</code>.</p>
        
            <p>【Potent Follow X%】<br>
            Triggers an additional follow-up attack immediately after unit's standard follow-up attack and <code>deals damage = X% of unit's normal attack damage</code> (if unit cannot make a follow-up attack, this effect triggers when the standard follow-up attack would occur; this effect is treated like a follow-up attack, so effects like "reduce damage by X%" still apply, but this effect is not affected by effects that prevent follow-ups or "attacks twice" effects; only highest value applied; does not stack).</p>
